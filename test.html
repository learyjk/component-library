            Don’t ever play yourself. You do know, you do know that they don’t
            want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you
            going do is have lunch. They will try to close the door on you, just
            open it. Wraith talk. Stay focused. Egg whites, turkey sausage,
            wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our
            breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast.
